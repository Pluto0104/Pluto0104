## Skills
I have experience in developing web applications using a variety of technologies and frameworks, such as:

•  HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap: I can create responsive and accessible web pages with modern styling and layout techniques.

•  JavaScript, TypeScript, ES6+: I can write clean and efficient code using the latest features and standards of the JavaScript language and its superset TypeScript.

•  React, Next.js, Redux, React Hooks: I can build dynamic and interactive user interfaces with React, a popular library for creating web components. I can also use Next.js for server-side rendering, Redux for state management, and React Hooks for custom logic.

•  Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Firebase: I can develop back-end services and APIs with Node.js, a runtime environment for JavaScript. I can also use Express for web application framework, MongoDB for database, and Firebase for authentication and hosting.

•  GraphQL, Apollo Client, Apollo Server: I can implement GraphQL, a query language for APIs that allows fetching and manipulating data efficiently. I can also use Apollo Client for consuming GraphQL APIs on the front-end and Apollo Server for creating GraphQL APIs on the back-end.

•  Jest, Cypress: I can test my code using Jest, a framework for unit testing and mocking. I can also use Cypress, a tool for end-to-end testing and automation.

•  Webpack, Babel, ESLint, Prettier: I can optimize my code using Webpack, a module bundler that helps with code splitting and performance. I can also use Babel for transpiling code to support older browsers, ESLint for code quality and style checking, and Prettier for code formatting.

•  Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions: I can manage my code using Git, a version control system that allows tracking changes and collaborating with others. I can also use GitHub for hosting my code repositories and GitHub Actions for automating workflows such as deployment and testing.
